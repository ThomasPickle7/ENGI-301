This is the PCB Layout for FitnessTracker. The PCB incorporates a 128x32 OLED screen, for which there is ample space on the board, as well as a gyroscope and weather sensor. 
The tracker has three buttons:
MODE: Changes between time mode, which tells the time, and tracking mode, which displays the steps tracked by the watch as well as the ambient temperature and humidity.
SET: Increments either the hours or minutes of the watch depending on which is selected
TOGGLE: toggles between the minutes and hours so that either can be incremented.
All processing on the FitnessTracker is done on the PocketBeagle, which is mounted with micro-USB facing out from the board.
