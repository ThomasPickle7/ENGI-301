This is the PCB Layout for FitnessTracker. The PCB incorporates a 128x32 OLED screen, for which there is ample space on the board, as well as a gyroscope and weather sensor. 
The tracker has three buttons:
MODE: Changes between time mode, which tells the time, and tracking mode, which displays the steps tracked by the watch as well as the ambient temperature and humidity.
SET: Increments either the hours or minutes of the watch depending on which is selected
TOGGLE: toggles between the minutes and hours so that either can be incremented.
All processing on the FitnessTracker is done on the PocketBeagle, which is mounted with micro-USB facing out from the board.

NOTE- BOM was formatting strangely when i tried to delete fiduciaries/mounting holes, so I manually typed it as well as submitted the raw BOM and added descriptions to the manually typed one. The one EAGLE Generated is labeled 'FitnessTracker BOM (GENERATED).csv'. Thank you and Merry Christmas
